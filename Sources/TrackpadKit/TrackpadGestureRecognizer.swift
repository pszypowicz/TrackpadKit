// TrackpadGestureRecognizer
//
// TrackpadKit's core: a raw-NSTouch trackpad gesture recognizer,
// self-contained on purpose - it depends only on Foundation and
// CoreGraphics, never sees NSTouch or NSEvent, and is driven entirely
// by TouchFrame values. That keeps it deterministic, replayable from
// disk, and portable into any host that can supply a touch stream
// (even across a C boundary). The DebugSnapshot API exists for
// visualizing hosts such as the gesture-lab harness overlay; hosts
// that don't visualize simply don't call it.
//
// Model (mirrors Apple's LightTable/DualTouchTracker sample, not
// NSGestureRecognizer - gesture recognizers do not receive trackpad
// touches):
//
//   idle -> settling <-> locked(N fingers) -> committed(swipe|pinch) -> idle
//                                                  \-> awaitingLift (drain) -/
//
// - settling: touches are landing; any finger-count change restarts a
//   short settle timer, so staggered landings still lock the intended
//   count and a transient graze (a thumb brushing the pad edge) leaves
//   the surviving fingers as the candidate set. Early motion locks
//   immediately (a moving hand is done landing).
// - locked: the candidate count. Both signals are measured from the
//   lock baseline: centroid translation (swipe) and mean distance from
//   centroid (pinch spread). Whichever crosses its threshold first,
//   with a dominance margin as hysteresis, captures the gesture for its
//   whole lifetime (commit-and-lock mutual exclusion). A count change
//   here re-settles rather than draining: nothing has been emitted
//   yet, so there is no action to protect.
// - committed: only the committed measure is reported. A lifted finger
//   ends the gesture (with fling velocity from the recent history); an
//   added finger cancels it. Either way we drain until all fingers are
//   up before recognizing anything new - one action per physical
//   gesture is the invariant awaitingLift exists to guarantee.
//
// Units: positions are normalizedPosition * deviceSize, i.e. device
// points (1/72 in), so thresholds are trackpad-size independent.
